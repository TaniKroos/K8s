# When a node has to go down for upgrade
# Pods on that node has to move to other nodes for availability
# $ kubectl drain node-0x
# This terminate the pods on the node-0x
# And create the same pods on other nodes
# And also mark the node unschedulable

# To make the node schedulable again 
# $ kubectl uncordon node-0x



# kubectl cordon node-0x // simply marks the node un schedulable
# It doesn't drain the nodes of existing pods


# $ kubeadm upgrade plan 
# First upgrade kubeadm itself => $ apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=<v>
# $ kubeadm upgrade  apply <v> //update control plane 
# $ apt-get upgrade kubelet<v> //update kubelet on master
